                YOUR NFT COLLECTION
                <br />
                NEEDS AN ALLOW-LIST
              </h1>
              <p className="lead mb-4">
                Popular NFT Collections have an allow-list that lets their
                engaged users mint their NFTs before the general public.
                However, those lists are very expensive to maintain on-chain.
                Some NFT Collection owners pay 10's of thousands of dollars to
                keep their allow-list up to date.
              </p>
              <p className="lead">
                Merkle Trees are a great solution to the problem! A merkle tree
                NEEDS just 32 bytes on-chain to validate an arbitrarily large
                list of allow-listed addresses. Updating the entire list costs
                hardly any gas!
              </p>
              <p className="lead">
                However, keepting track of all of those addresses takes time
                away from your developers. Validating an address as a
                white-listed address mints also requires a backend to supply the
                proof of the entire tree.
              </p>
              <p className="lead">
                Merkallow is designed to take this entire problem off of your
                hands so you can concentrate on making a great NFT Contract and
                art!
